# Getting Started

This is the official code that runs https://fun-banking.com. If you're curious about how it works or would like to run your own version (for whatever reason).

## Installation

We use NextJS and get our packages from npm. So you'll need NodeJS installed locally to run the application. Assuming you have that installed, you can run the following commands to get started locally:

```
git clone https://github.com/bytebury/fun-banking.git
cd fun-banking

npm install
npm run dev
```

That'll launch the application at `localhost:3000`.
